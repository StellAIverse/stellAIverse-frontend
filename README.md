# stellAIverse-frontend

## Overview

**stellAIverse** is a beautiful, immersive web application that transforms how you create and interact with AI agents. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, it features a stunning cosmic interface with a galaxy-style marketplace where you can browse, create, and deploy intelligent AI agents. Whether you're building custom agents to automate tasks, exploring community-created agents, or learning best practices in agent development, stellAIverse provides an intuitive platform with a visual experience that feels like exploring the stars.

The platform combines a powerful **agent creation wizard** (describe behavior → auto-generate basic contract + metadata), an interactive **chat interface** for agent interaction, a **portfolio dashboard** with performance stats, and an **educational mode** with tutorials on building smarter agents—all wrapped in a captivating cosmic UI theme with dark space backgrounds, glowing nebulae, and animated star constellations.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StellAIverse/stellAIverse-frontend.git
cd stellAIverse-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the necessary environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local  # if available, or create manually
```

Add the following (adjust based on your backend configuration):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 5. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### 6. Run Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### 7. PWA Setup (Optional)

For Progressive Web App features with aggressive caching:

```bash
# Quick PWA setup
chmod +x scripts/setup-pwa.sh
./scripts/setup-pwa.sh

# Or manual setup
npm install next-pwa workbox-webpack-plugin
node scripts/generate-icons.js
npm run build
```

### 8. Network Configuration

If running with a local backend, ensure:
- Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API runs on the configured `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- CORS is properly configured if frontend and backend are on different domains
